dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files and you need to install
the packages in `requirements.txt`.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If this is your first time installing dwm, you'll need to create a
desktop entry for dwm. Write to the file `/usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop`
the following content

```
[Desktop  Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=dwm
Exec=dwm
Comment=Dynamic Window Manager
Type=XSession
```

Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
