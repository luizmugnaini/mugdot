# Dotfiles üñáÔ∏è

These are my config files I use across all of my machines, be it Linux or Windows! I'm currently using my
own home-brewed dotfiles manager, [`stoic-dotfiles`](https://github.com/luizmugnaini/stoic).

## Usage

If you want to try my configs, feel free to do so. One way to setup all symlinks in Linux is to install
[`stoic-dotfiles`](https://crates.io/crates/stoic-dotfiles) via `cargo`:
```bash
cargo install stoic-dotfiles
```
and then just run `stoic` inside of the repository directory. On Windows I'm creating the directory
symlinks manually for the time being.
